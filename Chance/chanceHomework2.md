**Chance's Homework 2**

**Problem 1**

Issues: Had problems running root_scalar function of scipy.optimize, so I changed it to root function instead and addacted it accordingly.

For the cubic perturbation, the energy levels are lower than without a perturbation.
For the eigenfunctions of the cubic perturbation, the spacing between values (lines) of the eigenfunctions for different energy levels is greater than without a perturbation.

For the quartic perturbation, the energy levels are higher than without a perturbation.
For the eigenfunctions of the quartic perturbation, the spacing between values (lines) of the eigenfunctions for different energy levels is less than without a perturbation.

**Problem 2**

For part a, changed the variables accordingly and hit run.

For part b, comapred to expected exact solution.  Got amplitudes to match for this specific case.
