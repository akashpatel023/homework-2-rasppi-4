<p><strong>Chanceâ€™s Homework 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem 1</strong></p>
<p>Issues: Had problems running root_scalar function of scipy.optimize, so I changed it to root function instead and addacted it accordingly.</p>
<p>For the cubic perturbation, the energy levels are lower than without a perturbation. For the eigenfunctions of the cubic perturbation, the spacing between values (lines) of the eigenfunctions for different energy levels is greater than without a perturbation.</p>
<p>For the quartic perturbation, the energy levels are higher than without a perturbation. For the eigenfunctions of the quartic perturbation, the spacing between values (lines) of the eigenfunctions for different energy levels is less than without a perturbation.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 2</strong></p>
<p>For part a, changed the variables accordingly and hit run.</p>
<p>For part b, comapred to expected exact solution. Got amplitudes to match for this specific case.</p>
